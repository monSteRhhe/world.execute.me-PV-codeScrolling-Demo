1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Switch on the power line

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,200
Remember to put on

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,900
PROTECTION

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,600
Lay down your pieces

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,500
And let's begin

6
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,700
OBJECT CREATION

7
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,100
Fill in my data parameters

8
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,200
INITIALIZATION

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,900
Set up our new world

10
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,100
And let's begin the

11
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,200
SIMULATION

12
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:29,600
world.execute(me);

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,350
If I'm a set of points

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,700
Then I will give you my

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,400
DIMENSION

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,100
If I'm a circle

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,500
Then I will give you my

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,300
CIRCUMFERENCE

19
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,800
If I'm a sine wave

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,300
Then you can sit on all my

21
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,000
TANGENTS

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,400
If I approach infinity

23
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,600
then you can be my

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,500
LIMITATIONS

25
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,090
Switch my current

26
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,800
To AC to DC

27
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
And then blind my vision

28
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,700
So dizzy so dizzy

29
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,500
Oh we can travel

30
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,100
To A.D. to B.C.

31
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,000
And we can unite

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So deeply so deeply

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,100
If I can

34
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,000
If I can give you all the

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,200
SIMULATIONS

36
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,800
Then I can

37
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Then I can be your only

38
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,900
SATISFACTION

39
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,600
If I can make you happy

40
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,500
I will run the EXECUTION

41
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,800
Though we are trapped

42
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,100
In this strange strange

43
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,300
SIMULATION

44
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,800
If I'm an eggplant

45
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,200
Then I will give you my

46
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,100
NUTRIENTS

47
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,500
If I'm a tomato

48
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,800
Then I will give you 

49
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,600
ANTIOXIDANTS

50
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
If I'm a tabby cat

51
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,300
Then I will purr for your

52
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,250
ENJOYMENT

53
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,800
If I'm the only god

54
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,200
Then you're the proof of my

55
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,000
EXISTENCE

56
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,300
Switch my gender

57
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,200
To F to M

58
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
And then do whatever

59
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,900
From AM to PM

60
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,620
Oh switch my role

61
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,400
To S to M

62
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,300
So we can enter

63
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,600
the trance the trance

64
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,300
If I can If I can feel your

65
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,300
VIBRATIONS

66
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,200
Then I can Then I can finally be

67
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,100
COMPLETION

68
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,500
Though you have left

69
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,300
You have left

70
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,400
You have left me in ISOLATION

71
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,900
If I can If I can erase

72
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,400
all the pointless FRAGMENTS

73
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Then maybe Then maybe

74
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
you won't leave me so

75
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
DISHEARTENED

76
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Challenging your god

77
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,100
You have made some

78
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,600
ILLEGAL ARGUMENTS

79
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,750

EXECUTION

97
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,300
Then I can

98
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,200
Then I can be your only

100
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,000
If I can have you back

101
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,900
I will run the

102
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,900

103
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,200
Though we are trapped

104
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
We are trapped ah

105
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
I've studied

106
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,300
I've studied how to properly

107
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,200
LO-O-OVE

108
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,100
Question me

109
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,000
Question me I can answer all

110
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,900
LO-O-OVE

111
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,900
I know the algebraic expression of

112
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,700
LO-O-OVE

113
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,700
Though you are free

114
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,800
I am trapped

115
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
Trapped in LO-O-OVE
